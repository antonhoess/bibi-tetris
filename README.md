# Bibi Tetris
A simple Tetris version for my two beloved littel ones (Bibis).

It's implemented in C using Gtk+ and libcanberra for playing sounds.

It's graphics and layout is in some ways based on the ones from good old the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

Here's a screenhost on how ot looks so far:
